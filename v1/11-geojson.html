          <p>Typing up the coordinates for the <a href="/v1/10-leaflet#exercises">last homework
assignment</a> was, I imagine, not a lot of fun. It’s also
silly for me to assert, in the <a href="/v1/9-dataset">chapter before last</a>, that it’s
important to separate data wrangling from programming logic, only to then have you
run them together again. But the data structure for representing geographical
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Object</code>s in JavaScript, <strong>GeoJSON</strong>, is complex enough to warrant its own
chapter. That is this chapter, and in it we’ll be doing a bit of detective
work on a short poem in order to generate our dataset.</p>

<p>This chapter also marks the beginning of the end of the course, as we’ll be
working on this dataset, and the “‘Could Be’ Project,” for the rest of the
chapters. We’ve come so far in so short a time. In my class, you would already
be starting on your own final project, so I use the “Could Be” Project as an
opportunity to teach new techniques for building that project. If you want to
see the “finished” project, have a <a href="/v1/examples/could-be.html">look here</a>. It’s
not much because the text I’ve written is so thin, but you can at least see
what you, too, will be capable of.</p>

<section id="could-be">
  <h2 id="s-langston-hughess-could-be">Langston Hughes’s “Could Be”</h2>

  <p>The “Could Be” Project is a look at Langston Hughes’s poem, “Could
Be.”<sup id="fnref:could-be"><a href="#fn:could-be" class="footnote">1</a></sup> The complete text is available at <a href="http://www.songofamerica.net/song/could-be">Song of
America</a>, so I encourage you to
read it there. In 16 lines of poetry, Hughes manages to refer to five
different geographical spaces in the United States, with two of them being
mentioned twice apiece. The places he mentions are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Hastings Street</li>
    <li>Lenox Avenue</li>
    <li>18th &amp; Vine</li>
    <li>5th &amp; Mound</li>
    <li>Rampart</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I was thinking about this poem in the Spring, and I wondered if mapping it
might open up any sort of new interpretive angles into it. It’s also a good
poem for teaching digital mapping, because the amount of data is small but
important to the text as a whole. Your own projects will have considerably
more data.</p>

  <p>Yet in converting a poem into data, a scholar has to at the same time wonder
how that data should look. Remember, data are captured, so what information
should we capture when trying to represent this poem?</p>

</section>
<section id="geographical-data-structure">
  <h2 id="s-geographical-data-structure">Geographical data structure</h2>

  <p>For these five locations, clearly I need their names, so that I can tell them
apart. I also need their coordinates, if I plan on mapping them. In other
words, I’m already thinking about the data in terms of JavaScript <code class="highlighter-rouge">Object</code>s
and properties. Every <code class="highlighter-rouge">Place</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">Object</code> will have a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.name</code> property and a
<code class="highlighter-rouge">.coordinates</code> property.  Better: it’ll have both a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.lat</code> property for its
latitude and a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.lng</code> property for its longitude.</p>

  <p>What else could I include? How about how many times each place is mentioned?
OK, that’s a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.mentions</code> property. Then maybe the line number? OK, that’s the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">.line</code> property. But wait, two places are mentioned twice. How will the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">.line</code> property work there? Maybe <code class="highlighter-rouge">.line</code> should be an array, then, or
<code class="highlighter-rouge">.lines</code>. Finally, if the place has a Wikipedia article related to it, we can
include that link as the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.wikipedia</code> property.</p>

  <p>A way of thinking about <code class="highlighter-rouge">Object</code>s and properties that might be familiar to you
is as rows and columns in a spreadsheet. That is, each row is its own <code class="highlighter-rouge">Place</code>
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Object</code>, and each column is a property associated with it. In fact, that’s
what I did for this poem. It turns out that filling in the data is pretty easy
for each property <em>except</em> <code class="highlighter-rouge">.lat</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">.lng</code>, and <code class="highlighter-rouge">.wikipedia</code>. Those require
some digging.</p>

</section>
<section id="geo-sleuthing">
  <h2 id="s-geo-sleuthing">Geo-sleuthing</h2>

  <p>So how to fill in those coordinates? There are some immediate low-hanging
fruit, luckily. Lenox Avenue clearly refers to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenox_Avenue">avenue that runs through
Harlem</a>. Similarly, 18th &amp; Vine is
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/18th_and_Vine-Downtown_East,_Kansas_City">cradle of jazz in Kansas
City</a>.
Wikipedia even gives coordinates for the latter location, so I put those in
the spreadsheet.</p>

  <p>Lenox Avenue, on the other hand, is a long avenue. How can one point capture
all of it? One option would be to draw a line, of course. The other option
would be to arbitrarily select a point on the line. If you feed “Lenox Avenue”
into Google Maps, for example, it makes that arbitrary decision for you and
gives you coordinates between 127th and 128th Streets. That feels about right.</p>

  <p>Rampart provides a different obstacle. It’s a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rampart_Street">Rampart
Street</a> in New Orleans, so that
sorts out the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.wikipedia</code> property, but the coordinates Wikipedia gives are
bonkers. They are for the intersection of St. Philip St. and N Prieur St.,
about ten blocks away from Rampart. As the Wikipedia article notes, the
intersection of Rampart and Canal was a center of African-American life in New
Orleans, and as we’re already seeing, Hughes is referring to various urban
centers of African-American life. So, instead, I drop a marker at that
intersection and make note of those coordinates.</p>

  <p>Hastings Street was the center of African-American life in Detroit’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Bottom,_Detroit">Black
Bottom</a> neighborhood, but
there’s a problem. The street doesn’t really exist anymore, having been
cleared away to make space for Interstate 75. I looked up old maps of Detroit
and deduced the latitude and longitude for Hastings Street that way.</p>

  <p>5th &amp; Mound is trickier still. It, too, doesn’t exist anymore, the
intersection having been destroyed to make way, again, for Interstate 75.
Nevertheless, 5th &amp; Mound had been part of Cincinnati’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End,_Cincinnati">West
End</a>, which remains the
most African-American area in the city. Not much is available about this
neighborhood online, but the Cincinnati History Library and Archives provides
a <a href="http://library.cincymuseum.org/starweb/photos/servlet.starweb?path=photos/photo-session.web">search
tool</a>
that lets the user browse their Kenyon Barr Collection, which features a
series of creepy photos of the neighborhood, taken as the city was preparing
to raze it to the ground. Furthermore, as Steven C. Tracy notes in a history
of the Blues in Cincinnati, the Cotton Club, the most important venue for
African-American entertainers, <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=OGyWw-M5wFsC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=%22the+cotton+club+was+the+most+important+club+in+cincinnati%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-3pfb8vLVAhVi4IMKHQHXAQgQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22the%20cotton%20club%20was%20the%20most%20important%20club%20in%20cincinnati%22&amp;f=false">was only a block away, on 6th and
Mound</a>.
Either way, Mound Street still exists, as does 5th, but they no longer
intersect. I extrapolated their intersection and added those coordinates to
the dataset.</p>

  <p>The completed dataset, small as it is, is <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1u3rlflUa6q4wAQMtqwh_-WYM2J2RIB8id4yzRNxojSM/edit?usp=sharing">available as a Google Sheets
document</a>.
Building out the data in a spreadsheet made the data entry straightforward,
but, unfortunately, Leaflet can’t simply read a spreadsheet. We need an
intermediate step.</p>

</section>
<section id="geojson-format">

  <h2 id="s-the-geojson-format">The GeoJSON format</h2>

  <p>You learned about JSON when working with Chaucer’s General Prologue back in
<a href="/v1/9-dataset">Chapter 9</a>. A subset of it, <a href="http://geojson.org/">GeoJSON</a>, is a
handy way to describe geographical data, one that Leaflet understands. In
fact, we can describe our Hastings Street point in GeoJSON like this:</p>

  <div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span>
  <span class="s2">"type"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"Feature"</span><span class="p">,</span>
  <span class="s2">"geometry"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s2">"type"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"Point"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">"coordinates"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">83.0370</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mf">42.3340</span><span class="p">]</span>
  <span class="p">},</span>
  <span class="s2">"properties"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="s2">"name"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"Hastings Street"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">"html"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"Hastings Street"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">"tab"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"hastings-street"</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">"mentions"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span>
    <span class="s2">"lines"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">13</span><span class="p">],</span>
    <span class="s2">"wikipedia"</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Bottom,_Detroit"</span>
  <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>  </div>

  <p>Our point is a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Feature</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">Object</code> in GeoJSON. Notice, however, that the
coordinates are flipped. Instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">[lat, lng]</code>, like in Leaflet, the
coordinates here are <code class="highlighter-rouge">[lng, lat]</code>. Instead of having an endless list of
potential properties, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Feature</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">Object</code> has three, a <code class="highlighter-rouge">.type</code>, a
<code class="highlighter-rouge">.geometry</code>, and its own <code class="highlighter-rouge">.properties</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">Object</code>. That <code class="highlighter-rouge">Object</code>’s properties are
where we can stash our own properties like <code class="highlighter-rouge">.wikipedia</code>. I made the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.lines</code>
property an array by enclosing it in brackets. The <code class="highlighter-rouge">.tab</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">.html</code>
properties will become important in <a href="/v1/14-events-popups">Chapter 14</a>.</p>

  <p>With as small a dataset as the one we have for “Could Be,” generating a
GeoJSON file “by hand” would not be too difficult. However, there are online
tools that convert spreadsheets to GeoJSON. <a href="http://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-geojson.htm">Convert
CSV</a>, for example, lets you even
paste in the data you copy from a spreadsheet. In the second step, you note
whether the first row is column headers (typically yes), and in the third
step, you mark which two columns feature latitudes and longitudes.</p>

  <p>The result is available <a href="/v1/could-be.geo.json">here</a>. As you can see, the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Feature</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">Object</code>s are collected into an array that is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.features</code> property
of a <code class="highlighter-rouge">FeatureCollection</code> <code class="highlighter-rouge">Object</code>.</p>

  <p>This is identical to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">leaflet.html</code>, except the content is a bit
different, and it’s loading <code class="highlighter-rouge">could-be.js</code> instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">leaflet.js</code>.
Furthermore, the map’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;div&gt;</code> is called <code class="highlighter-rouge">#could-be-map</code>.</p>

  <p>Set up <code class="highlighter-rouge">could-be.js</code> similarly to <code class="highlighter-rouge">leaflet.js</code>:</p>

  <p>Save and open <code class="highlighter-rouge">could-be.html</code> in the browser. If the map appears, go ahead and
commit. You can load the GeoJSON just like we loaded regular JSON, using the
jQuery <code class="highlighter-rouge">$.getJSON()</code> method. Now, Leaflet offers an <code class="highlighter-rouge">L.geoJSON()</code> method that
would make adding the GeoJSON one line of code. But, trust me on this, it will
be easier to do a bit of extra work here and avoid using that method. Instead,
we’ll create an array of <code class="highlighter-rouge">object</code>s, <code class="highlighter-rouge">couldBeFeatures</code>, where each <code class="highlighter-rouge">object</code> has
the properties of each of the GeoJSON features. So, add to
<code class="highlighter-rouge">could-be.js</code>:</p>

  <p>Notice that, except for the  definition of <code class="highlighter-rouge">couldBeFeatures</code>, all of the
Leaflet work is happening inside the callback function, because <code class="highlighter-rouge">$.getJSON()</code>
is async.<sup id="fnref:global-layer"><a href="#fn:global-layer" class="footnote">2</a></sup> I also introduce three new methods here.
<code class="highlighter-rouge">.getBounds()</code> returns the bounding box that contains the entirety of a layer,
in this case our <code class="highlighter-rouge">couldBeLayer</code>.  That is fed as a parameter to
<code class="highlighter-rouge">.fitBounds()</code>, which changes the map <code class="highlighter-rouge">Object</code>’s state to a new zoom level and
center coordinate. Then I use the map <code class="highlighter-rouge">Object</code>’s <code class="highlighter-rouge">.zoomOut()</code> method to zoom
out a smidge to make all the markers appear on the map. <code class="highlighter-rouge">couldBeLayer</code>, in the
meantime, is a Leaflet feature group <code class="highlighter-rouge">Object</code>, as it is made up of several
markers.</p>

  <p>Save and reload. Your map should now show the whole United States and feature
five markers, one over New York, one over Cincinnati, one over Kansas City,
one over Detroit, and one over New Orleans. Otherwise, catch up with the work
I have done so far <a href="/v1/examples/could-be11.html">over here</a> in oder to see what
the project looks like.</p>
