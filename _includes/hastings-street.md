## Hastings Street

Hastings Street was a major thoroughfare in the [Black
Bottom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Bottom,_Detroit) neighborhood of
Detroit. It was largely razed to the ground to make room for the [Chrysler
Freeway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrysler_Freeway).[^1]

[^1]: The Chrysler Freeway is part of Interstate 75, which, coincidentally, was also why 5th & Mound was razed to the ground.
