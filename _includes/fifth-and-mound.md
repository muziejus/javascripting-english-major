## 5th & Mound

5th & Mound is an intersection in Cincinnati that doesn’t exist anymore. It
was destroyed to make way for Interstate 75. Nevertheless, 5th & Mound had
been part of Cincinnati’s [West End](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End,_Cincinnati), which remains
the most African-American area in the city. Not much is available about this
neighborhood online, but the Cincinnati History Library and Archives provides
a [search
tool](http://library.cincymuseum.org/starweb/photos/servlet.starweb?path=photos/photo-session.web)
that lets the user browse their Kenyon Barr Collection, which features a
series of creepy photos of the neighborhood, taken as the city was preparing
to raze it to the ground. Furthermore, as Steven C. Tracy notes in a history
of the Blues in Cincinnati, the Cotton Club, the most important venue for
African-American entertainers, [was only a block away, on 6th and
Mound](https://books.google.com/books?id=OGyWw-M5wFsC&pg=PA89&dq=%22the+cotton+club+was+the+most+important+club+in+cincinnati%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-3pfb8vLVAhVi4IMKHQHXAQgQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&q=%22the%20cotton%20club%20was%20the%20most%20important%20club%20in%20cincinnati%22&f=false).
