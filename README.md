# The JavaScripting English Major

This repository hosts the course *The JavaScripting English Major*, by me,
[Moacir P. de Sá Pereira](http://moacir.com). It is served (via GitHub pages)
at
[http://the-javascripting-english-major.org/](http://the-javascripting-english-major.org/).

The course is divided into 15 sessions and is designed to teach humanities
undergraduates how to build a web project. More concretely, it teaches
students basics on using:

* Git
* GitHub (and GH Pages)
* Atom
* JavaScript
* jQuery
* Bootstrap
* Leaflet
* GeoJSON
* Markdown

It is largely based on Marijn Haverbeke’s [*Eloquent
JavaScript*](http://eloquentjavascript.com), but it strips out parts of that
wonderful book that are of limited value to students eager to build simple
projects, not understand a language deeply.

Its companion repository—that has the “course materials,” thin as they are—is
[@muziejus/javascripting-english-major-project](https://github.com/muziejus/javascripting-english-major-project).
which students fork and then change to meet their desires, as noted in the
first chapter of the course.
