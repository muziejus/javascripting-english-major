Could be Hastings Street,<br />
Or Lenox Avenue,<br />
Could be 18th & Vine<br />
And still be true.<br />

Could be 5th & Mound,<br />
Could be Rampart:<br />
When you pawned my watch<br />
You pawned my heart.<br />

Could be you love me,<br />
Could be that you don't.<br />
Might be that you'll come back,<br />
Like as not you won't.<br />

Hastings Street is weary,<br />
Also Lenox Avenue.<br />
Any place is dreary<br />
Without my watch and you.<br />

-- _The Collected Poems of Langston Hughes_, p. 366
